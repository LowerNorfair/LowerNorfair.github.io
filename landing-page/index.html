                    <p><i>3 May. Bistritz.</i>—Left Munich at 8:35 <span>P. M.</span>, on 1st May, arriving at
                        Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an
                        hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I
                        got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the
                        streets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived
                        late and would start as near the correct time as possible. The
                        impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the
                        East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is
                        here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish
                        rule.</p>
                        
                        <p>We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh.
                        Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or
                        rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was
                        very good but thirsty. (<i>Mem.</i>, get recipe for Mina.) I asked the
                        waiter, and he said it was called “paprika hendl,” and that, as it was a
                        national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the
                        Carpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here; indeed, I
                        don’t know how I should be able to get on without it.</p>

                    <h3>CHAPTER II. Jonathan Harker’s Journal</h3>
                    <p><i>5 May.</i>—I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had been fully
                        awake I must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place. In
                        the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several dark
                        ways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger than
                        it really is. I have not yet been able to see it by daylight.</p>
                        
                        <p>When the calèche stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand
                        to assist me to alight. Again I could not but notice his prodigious
                        strength. His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have
                        crushed mine if he had chosen. Then he took out my traps, and placed
                        them on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and
                        studded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of
                        massive stone. I could see even in the dim light that the stone was
                        massively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and
                        weather. As I stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the
                        reins; the horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared down one
                        of the dark openings.</p>

                    <h3>CHAPTER III. Jonathan Harker’s Journal</h3>
                    <p>W<small>HEN</small> I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me.
                        I rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering out of
                        every window I could find; but after a little the conviction of my
                        helplessness overpowered all other feelings. When I look back after a
                        few hours I think I must have been mad for the time, for I behaved much
                        as a rat does in a trap. When, however, the conviction had come to me
                        that I was helpless I sat down quietly—as quietly as I have ever done
                        anything in my life—and began to think over what was best to be done. I
                        am thinking still, and as yet have come to no definite conclusion. Of
                        one thing only am I certain; that it is no use making my ideas known to
                        the Count. He knows well that I am imprisoned; and as he has done it
                        himself, and has doubtless his own motives for it, he would only deceive
                        me if I trusted him fully with the facts. So far as I can see, my only
                        plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself, and my eyes
                        open. I am, I know, either being deceived, like a baby, by my own fears,
                        or else I am in desperate straits; and if the latter be so, I need, and
                        shall need, all my brains to get through.</p>
                        
                        <p>I had hardly come to this conclusion when I heard the great door below
                        shut, and knew that the Count had returned. He did not come at once into
                        the library, so I went cautiously to my own room and found him making
                        the bed. This was odd, but only confirmed what I had all along
                        thought—that there were no servants in the house. When later I saw him
                        through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the
                        dining-room, I was assured of it; for if he does himself all these
                        menial offices, surely it is proof that there is no one else to do them.
                        This gave me a fright, for if there is no one else in the castle, it
                        must have been the Count himself who was the driver of the coach that
                        brought me here. This is a terrible thought; for if so, what does it
                        mean that he could control the wolves, as he did, by only holding up his
                        hand in silence. How was it that all the people at Bistritz and on the
                        coach had some terrible fear for me? What meant the giving of the
                        crucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash? Bless
                        that good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck! for it is a
                        comfort and a strength to me whenever I touch it. It is odd that a thing
                        which I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous
                        should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help. Is it that there
                        is something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is a medium,
                        a tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort? Some
                        time, if it may be, I must examine this matter and try to make up my
                        mind about it. In the meantime I must find out all I can about Count
                        Dracula, as it may help me to understand. To-night he may talk of
                        himself, if I turn the conversation that way. I must be very careful,
                        however, not to awake his suspicion.</p>

                    <h3>CHAPTER IV. Jonathan Harker’s Journal</h3>
                    <p>I <small>AWOKE</small> in my own bed. If it be that I had not dreamt, the Count must
                        have carried me here. I tried to satisfy myself on the subject, but
                        could not arrive at any unquestionable result. To be sure, there were
                        certain small evidences, such as that my clothes were folded and laid by
                        in a manner which was not my habit. My watch was still unwound, and I am
                        rigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going to bed, and
                        many such details. But these things are no proof, for they may have been
                        evidences that my mind was not as usual, and, from some cause or
                        another, I had certainly been much upset. I must watch for proof. Of one
                        thing I am glad: if it was that the Count carried me here and undressed
                        me, he must have been hurried in his task, for my pockets are intact. I
                        am sure this diary would have been a mystery to him which he would not
                        have brooked. He would have taken or destroyed it. As I look round this
                        room, although it has been to me so full of fear, it is now a sort of
                        sanctuary, for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful women, who
                        were—who <i>are</i>—waiting to suck my blood.</p>
                        
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        
                        <p><i>18 May.</i>—I have been down to look at that room again in daylight, for
                        I <i>must</i> know the truth. When I got to the doorway at the top of the
                        stairs I found it closed. It had been so forcibly driven against the
                        jamb that part of the woodwork was splintered. I could see that the bolt
                        of the lock had not been shot, but the door is fastened from the inside.
                        I fear it was no dream, and must act on this surmise.</p>
                        
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        
                        <p><i>19 May.</i>—I am surely in the toils. Last night the Count asked me in
                        the suavest tones to write three letters, one saying that my work here
                        was nearly done, and that I should start for home within a few days,
                        another that I was starting on the next morning from the time of the
                        letter, and the third that I had left the castle and arrived at
                        Bistritz. I would fain have rebelled, but felt that in the present state
                        of things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the Count whilst I
                        am so absolutely in his power; and to refuse would be to excite his
                        suspicion and to arouse his anger. He knows that I know too much, and
                        that I must not live, lest I be dangerous to him; my only chance is to
                        prolong my opportunities. Something may occur which will give me a
                        chance to escape. I saw in his eyes something of that gathering wrath
                        which was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from him. He explained
                        to me that posts were few and uncertain, and that my writing now would
                        ensure ease of mind to my friends; and he assured me with so much
                        impressiveness that he would countermand the later letters, which would
                        be held over at Bistritz until due time in case chance would admit of my
                        prolonging my stay, that to oppose him would have been to create new
                        suspicion. I therefore pretended to fall in with his views, and asked
                        him what dates I should put on the letters. He calculated a minute, and
                        then said:—</p>
                        
                        <p>“The first should be June 12, the second June 19, and the third June
                        29.”</p>
                        
                        <p>I know now the span of my life. God help me!</p>

                    <p>“My dearest Lucy,—</p>

                    <p>“Forgive my long delay in writing, but I have been simply overwhelmed
                    with work. The life of an assistant schoolmistress is sometimes trying.
                    I am longing to be with you, and by the sea, where we can talk together
                    freely and build our castles in the air. I have been working very hard
                    lately, because I want to keep up with Jonathan’s studies, and I have
                    been practising shorthand very assiduously. When we are married I shall
                    be able to be useful to Jonathan, and if I can stenograph well enough I
                    can take down what he wants to say in this way and write it out for him
                    on the typewriter, at which also I am practising very hard. He and I
                    sometimes write letters in shorthand, and he is keeping a stenographic
                    journal of his travels abroad. When I am with you I shall keep a diary
                    in the same way. I don’t mean one of those
                    two-pages-to-the-week-with-Sunday-squeezed-in-a-corner diaries, but a
                    sort of journal which I can write in whenever I feel inclined. I do not
                    suppose there will be much of interest to other people; but it is not
                    intended for them. I may show it to Jonathan some day if there is in it
                    anything worth sharing, but it is really an exercise book. I shall try
                    to do what I see lady journalists do: interviewing and writing
                    descriptions and trying to remember conversations. I am told that, with
                    a little practice, one can remember all that goes on or that one hears
                    said during a day. However, we shall see. I will tell you of my little
                    plans when we meet. I have just had a few hurried lines from Jonathan
                    from Transylvania. He is well, and will be returning in about a week. I
                    am longing to hear all his news. It must be so nice to see strange
                    countries. I wonder if we—I mean Jonathan and I—shall ever see them
                    together. There is the ten o’clock bell ringing. Good-bye.</p>

                    <p><i>24 July. Whitby.</i>—Lucy met me at the station, looking sweeter and
                        lovelier than ever, and we drove up to the house at the Crescent in
                        which they have rooms. This is a lovely place. The little river, the
                        Esk, runs through a deep valley, which broadens out as it comes near the
                        harbour. A great viaduct runs across, with high piers, through which the
                        view seems somehow further away than it really is. The valley is
                        beautifully green, and it is so steep that when you are on the high land
                        on either side you look right across it, unless you are near enough to
                        see down. The houses of the old town—the side away from us—are all
                        red-roofed, and seem piled up one over the other anyhow, like the
                        pictures we see of Nuremberg. Right over the town is the ruin of Whitby
                        Abbey, which was sacked by the Danes, and which is the scene of part of
                        “Marmion,” where the girl was built up in the wall. It is a most noble
                        ruin, of immense size, and full of beautiful and romantic bits; there is
                        a legend that a white lady is seen in one of the windows. Between it and
                        the town there is another church, the parish one, round which is a big
                        graveyard, all full of tombstones. This is to my mind the nicest spot in
                        Whitby, for it lies right over the town, and has a full view of the
                        harbour and all up the bay to where the headland called Kettleness
                        stretches out into the sea. It descends so steeply over the harbour that
                        part of the bank has fallen away, and some of the graves have been
                        destroyed. In one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches
                        out over the sandy pathway far below. There are walks, with seats beside
                        them, through the churchyard; and people go and sit there all day long
                        looking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze. I shall come and
                        sit here very often myself and work. Indeed, I am writing now, with my
                        book on my knee, and listening to the talk of three old men who are
                        sitting beside me. They seem to do nothing all day but sit up here and
                        talk.</p>
                        
                        <p>The harbour lies below me, with, on the far side, one long granite wall
                        stretching out into the sea, with a curve outwards at the end of it, in
                        the middle of which is a lighthouse. A heavy sea-wall runs along outside
                        of it. On the near side, the sea-wall makes an elbow crooked inversely,
                        and its end too has a lighthouse. Between the two piers there is a
                        narrow opening into the harbour, which then suddenly widens.</p>
                        
                        <p>It is nice at high water; but when the tide is out it shoals away to
                        nothing, and there is merely the stream of the Esk, running between
                        banks of sand, with rocks here and there. Outside the harbour on this
                        side there rises for about half a mile a great reef, the sharp edge of
                        which runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse. At the end of
                        it is a buoy with a bell, which swings in bad weather, and sends in a
                        mournful sound on the wind. They have a legend here that when a ship is
                        lost bells are heard out at sea. I must ask the old man about this; he
                        is coming this way....</p>

                        <p>O<small>NE</small> of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been
                        experienced here, with results both strange and unique. The weather had
                        been somewhat sultry, but not to any degree uncommon in the month of
                        August. Saturday evening was as fine as was ever known, and the great
                        body of holiday-makers laid out yesterday for visits to Mulgrave Woods,
                        Robin Hood’s Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and the various trips in
                        the neighbourhood of Whitby. The steamers <i>Emma</i> and <i>Scarborough</i> made
                        trips up and down the coast, and there was an unusual amount of
                        “tripping” both to and from Whitby. The day was unusually fine till the
                        afternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent the East Cliff
                        churchyard, and from that commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of
                        sea visible to the north and east, called attention to a sudden show of
                        “mares’-tails” high in the sky to the north-west. The wind was then
                        blowing from the south-west in the mild degree which in barometrical
                        language is ranked “No. 2: light breeze.” The coastguard on duty at once
                        made report, and one old fisherman, who for more than half a century has
                        kept watch on weather signs from the East Cliff, foretold in an emphatic
                        manner the coming of a sudden storm. The approach of sunset was so very
                        beautiful, so grand in its masses of splendidly-coloured clouds, that
                        there was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old
                        churchyard to enjoy the beauty. Before the sun dipped below the black
                        mass of Kettleness, standing boldly athwart the western sky, its
                        downward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset-colour—flame,
                        purple, pink, green, violet, and all the tints of gold; with here and
                        there masses not large, but of seemingly absolute blackness, in all
                        sorts of shapes, as well outlined as colossal silhouettes. The
                        experience was not lost on the painters, and doubtless some of the
                        sketches of the “Prelude to the Great Storm” will grace the R. A. and R.
                        I. walls in May next. More than one captain made up his mind then and
                        there that his “cobble” or his “mule,” as they term the different
                        classes of boats, would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed.
                        The wind fell away entirely during the evening, and at midnight there
                        was a dead calm, a sultry heat, and that prevailing intensity which, on
                        the approach of thunder, affects persons of a sensitive nature. There
                        were but few lights in sight at sea, for even the coasting steamers,
                        which usually “hug” the shore so closely, kept well to seaward, and but
                        few fishing-boats were in sight. The only sail noticeable was a foreign
                        schooner with all sails set, which was seemingly going westwards. The
                        foolhardiness or ignorance of her officers was a prolific theme for
                        comment whilst she remained in sight, and efforts were made to signal
                        her to reduce sail in face of her danger. Before the night shut down she
                        was seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating
                        swell of the sea,</p>
                        
                        <p>“As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean.”</p>
