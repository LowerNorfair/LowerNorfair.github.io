# Landing page - Dracula by Bram Stoker
This project simulates an online book/article reader with a reactive table of contents.

## Usage


Use the navigation to skip to different chapters of the book. 

On smaller screens, the navigation can be open and closed by clicking the TOC button at the top right-hand corner of the screen.

## Demo
[Index page](github.com/lowernorfair/landing-page/index.html)

## Features
- The script collects any h2 or h3 headings and creates the table of contents (TOC) based on their text
- Clicking TOC links smooth-scrolls to the section
- TOC highlights the active section
- Inactive sections are faded
- TOC shrinks on smaller screens
